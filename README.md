# Get instant audience feedback

plodo is a nice little utility you can use to get immediate feedback from your audience while you present.

# So how does it look?
In the presenter's app, you can set up a new session and follow live feedback as your audience submits it via a mobile website:

Start session | Playing session | Mobile - join session | Mobile - play in a session
--- | --- | --- | ---
<img src="/artwork/screenshots/start-session.png" height="400" /> | <img src="/artwork/screenshots/playing-session.png" height="400" /> | <img src="/artwork/screenshots/mobile-join-session.png" height="400" /> | <img src="/artwork/screenshots/mobile-playing-session.png" height="400" />


# How do I install it?

plodo will be available from the Mac App Store, Windows Store and on the Office 365 Marketplace once it is released.

You can find beta releases on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/larsbaunwall/plodo/releases) :star:

The feedback client is available at https://www-qa.plodo.io :muscle:

Please try it out - and follow our repo for more updates!
